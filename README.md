# Chunky's Challenge

> Clever 2D Puzzle Game with Chunky Graphics

Chunky is not your average hero. They are square, quirkily drawn, and they have
an unquenchable thirst for solving puzzles.

- 100 clever puzzles? Check! (Well... 100 is our target for release, currently there are fewer!)
- Chunky graphics? Check!
- Push purple creatures on a mine using transporter belts? Boom!
- Child-friendly and educational? Check!
- Remake of a [20-year old indie game](https://store.kde.org/p/1109408/)? Check!
- Ads and in-app purchases? Never!
